                    <p>In the time since this project, The Buff Restaurant has actually updated their website. The original site 
                        that this project is based on can still be found on the 
                        <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231004091621/https://www.buffrestaurant.com/">Wayback Machine</a> 
                        or in my <a href="https://elsm2388.github.io/CSCI-ATLS-3150/buffrest/home.html">Github files</a> for this 
                        project. The Buff Restaurant’s current website can be found at <a href="https://www.buffrestaurant.com">www.buffrestaurant.com</a>.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Business Description</h3>
                    <p>The Buff Restaurant in Boulder, CO is a local breakfast spot that is a go-to place for early risers and 
                        brunch enthusiasts alike. The friendly staff welcomes guests with warm smiles, creating a homey atmosphere 
                        with routine customers. The menu is filled with classic morning fare, featuring fluffy pancakes dripping 
                        with maple syrup, hearty omelets, and local ground coffee. Many customers make it a point to visit The 
                        Buff Restaurant when they are in town or make a weekly visit for breakfast. </p>
                    <h3>Project Goals</h3>
                    <p>The current website of The Buff Restaurant showcases their hours, their menu, about them, and ways to 
                        contact them as their main focal points. Additionally, customers can click links that go to external 
                        websites to order food online for pickup or delivery, buy gift certificates, and check the balances of 
                        their gift certificates.
                    </p>
                    <p>As it stands, there are several issues with the current version of The Buff Restaurant’s website. We plan 
                        to make the site more user friendly and accessible through improving the structure of web pages, improving 
                        color contrast, removing distracting elements, replacing important text-based images such that the content 
                        can be read with assistive technology, and ensuring that webpages can be resized without loss of content or 
                        functionality. Firstly, the current structure of The Buff Restaurant’s web pages, such as page layout and 
                        order of information provided, could be improved. The structure of the website is somewhat inconsistent and 
                        not always informative to the content included. For example, the main content of the “Contact” page includes 
                        several headers of size h6, with no bigger headers above them. We plan to improve this by adding headers and 
                        changing some of the tag sizes of the headers currently included. Additionally, color contrast and font size 
                        could use some improvement. Although the accessibility tool WAVE doesn’t detect contrast of background 
                        gradients and transparency, there are some contrast errors between text on the website and its wood-patterned 
                        background. We plan to address this by either adding a background to text that passes WCAG standards or 
                        changing the website’s wood-patterned background to a color or image that doesn’t cause contrast issues. 
                        Furthermore, there are some distracting elements on the “Home” and “Contact” pages that we plan to remove 
                        while still alerting customers to the importance of the content. Additionally, the menus provided by The 
                        Buff Restaurant appear to be poor-quality images that cannot be read by screen readers. We plan to fix this 
                        by replacing the images of the menu with searchable pdfs or perhaps even simple text. Finally, all of the 
                        webpages on the website require horizontal scrolling when zoomed in too far. We plan to edit the HTML such 
                        that we follow WCAG’s Guideline 1.4 - Distinguishable and 1.4.4 Resize Text - Level AA, which states that 
                        “Except for captions and images of text, text can be resized without assistive technology up to 200 percent 
                        without loss of content or functionality.”

                    <p style="display: inline;">November 19, 2023</p>
                    <h4>Methods</h4>
                    <p>We used WAVE, a web accessibility evaluation tool powered by WebAim; the Chrome extension Web Developer by 
                        Chris Pederick; and a Mac application called “Color Picker.” WAVE and Web Developer were used together for 
                        most of the items; Color Picker was only used for the Color Contrast item in order to determine the color 
                        ratios of text on a patterned background.</p>

                                <td>Recommendation: 
                                    Most of the page titles are already front-loaded, succinct, and distinguished from each other, which is good. However, the title for the home page of the website, “The Buff Restaurant | Boulder, CO,” could be improved by stating that it’s the home page: “The Buff Restaurant home page.”

I would say that except for the background image, which is purely decorative, all of the links could be better. The current alt text of the linked logo image is empty/null, and the linked social media images state the respective titles of the websites that they’re linked to: “Instagram,” “Trip Advisor,” etc. Most of the text included in the images on this page should be included, except for maybe the word “Icon” at the end of the alt text of the linked image “Yelp! App Icon.”</td>
                                <td>Recommendation: 
                                    Firstly, we recommend that alt text should be added to the linked logo image above the navigation bar. Since the image links to the home page of the site, we recommend that the alt text should read “The Buff Restaurant home.” In addition, the linked social media images could include the words “The Buff Restaurant” to ensure that users know that the link goes to the social media page of The Buff Restaurant, and not just that social media website in general. For example, the current alt text “Instagram” could be changed to “The Buff Restaurant Instagram.”

                                <td>There were headers on three of the five pages of The Buff Restaurant’s website. Of the pages that had headers, none of them had headings marked up as &lt;h1&gt;. Because of that, on the pages that had headings, the heading sizes didn’t make sense in terms of organizational layout. Most of the headings did generally precede related paragraphs or content. However, some of the headings do not make sense out of context. For example, there’s an h2 header on the Home page that states “7AM-2PM” that doesn’t precede related content or make much sense out of context. That, along with the text “Dining room and Patio OPEN” on the Home page, should probably not be marked up as headers. </td>
                                <td>Recommendation: 
                                    We recommend adding an h1 heading to each page that encompasses the purpose of each page. For example, the “Dine-in Menu” page, one of the two pages without any headings at all, could have the title “Dine-in Menu” marked up as an &lt;h1&gt; heading. Furthermore, certain headings that are already present could change to a different size of heading. For example, the several h6 headings on the “Contact” page could be changed to h2 headings under a new h1 heading that says “Contact Us.” Additionally, we recommend removing header tags from the text that we identified on the Home page that should not be a header: “7AM-2PM” and “Dining room and Patio OPEN.”

                                <td>While according to WAVE, there are no contrast errors on the home page of The Buff Restaurant, we also checked with the Mac application Color Picker. The lightest part of the wooden background was about #F3E2AC, whereas the darkest part was about #231207. The text that lays against the wooden background included #292929 and #373B4E. As such, the website passes the WCAG requirements in the places that the background is lighter with the #F3E2AC color, but the website fails the requirements in the places where the background is darker. Because the text colors are similar in color, there are no places where the text passes the Level AA WCAG requirements but not the Level AAA.</td>
                                <td>Recommendation: 
                                    We recommend that The Buff Restaurant either change the background behind text to a solid color that will pass the WCAG contrast requirements. This could be done by changing the site’s wooden background to a solid color, changing only the background color of text, or adding a background color behind each section of the website while still keeping the wooden background in the border areas.

                    <p>For our changes to the outline of The Buff Restaurant’s website, we decided to make the website feel more
                         modern, reposition elements, create more structure by adding headers, and improve forms. While we 
                         repositioned a lot of elements, please note that we tried to keep most of the content that the original 
                         developers of the website decided to include on each page as a way to ensure that the purposes of the 
                         website were still present.
                    </p>
                    <p>Firstly, the current website of The Buff Restaurant feels very outdated. As such, we decided to change the 
                        position of a few of the elements to give our version of the website a cleaner and more modern feel. For 
                        example, the navigation bar of the current website is below a large image of The Buff Restaurant’s logo 
                        and obscures the majority of the screen when landing on a new page. Because this design forces the user 
                        to scroll down just to understand the important information on a new page and simply isn’t aesthetically 
                        pleasing, we changed the navigation bar to be at the very top of the page, with the restaurant’s logo at 
                        the left of the navigation bar and the page tabs oriented to the right. This new design is in line with 
                        many modern websites and doesn’t require the user to scroll down nearly as much as the website’s current 
                        design.
                    </p>
                    <p>In addition to changing the position of the navigation bar and logo, we also rearranged the main content 
                        of both the home page and the contact page, separating sections and making each page more linear. For 
                        example, on the homepage of the current website, there are four buttons in a 2x2 grid with no section 
                        header above them. Of these buttons, two address online orders and two address gift certificates. We 
                        thought that it was odd that these were all grouped together, so we separated them into two different 
                        categories with the titles “Order Online” and “Gift Certificates.” These titles are intended to be marked 
                        up as &lt;h2&gt; and will add structure to our redesigned website.
                    </p>
                    <p>Furthermore, none of the pages of the current website of The Buff have headers marked up as 
                        &lt;h1&gt;. As this is an issue that affects users experiencing the page both visually and 
                        non-visually, we added titles to the top of each page, intended to be marked up as &lt;h1&gt;. 
                        For the home page, this title is “Welcome to The Buff Restaurant,” and for the contact page, this title is 
                        “Contact Us.” 
                    </p>
                    <p>We also thought that it would be appropriate to add a form to the contact page in place of a link to email 
                        as well as improve the existing form on the home page by using the techniques that we learned in class. The 
                        form on the current home page does not indicate the required fields unless a user clicks on the button to 
                        submit the form with one or more of the fields missing. With our changes, text before the form indicates 
                        that all fields are required as well as putting asterisks after each field name. Moreover, the form on the 
                        current home page states the name of the desired input of each text field within the textbox, and these 
                        names disappear as soon as a user starts typing within a textbox. We tried to make the form less confusing 
                        by following the form structure proposed in class by placing the name of the desired input to the left of 
                        the field.
                    </p>

                    <img src="../media/sitemap_before.png" width="65%" alt="Diagram of the site map of The Buff Restaurant's current website. A bubble with 'The Buff Restaurant' is above and connected to five other bubbles with the words 'Home,' 'About,' 'Dine-in Menu,' 'Drinks,' and 'Contact.'" style="border: 1px solid #333; border-radius: 4px;">
                    <p><br>The Buff Restaurant’s current website is fairly simple, with only five pages with a couple links to external 
                        sites. We decided to not change the sitemap, as we felt that their current design was straightforward and 
                        effective in conveying information relevant to their business. Furthermore, many other restaurants have 
                        similar sitemaps, so we feel confident that this is a solid design.</p>

                    <h3>Persona Walk-Through of Redesigned Site</h3>
                    <p>Going through the website, Alex would be able to use assistive technology to read the text displayed on 
                        the screen. It would first read the navigation menu: home, about, dine-in, menu, drinks, and contact. 
                        Then, the assistive technology would further read, "Welcome to The Buff Restaurant," along with a description 
                        about the image, and present options for ordering online and purchasing gift certificates.</p>
                    <p>When it gets to the sign-up section for offers, which is the information Alex is looking for, it would read, 
                        "Sign up for offers" in big, contrasting letters. The instructions would guide Alex to enter his name and 
                        email in the provided form to receive offers from us sent to his inbox. The assistive technology would then 
                        assist Alex in inputting his name and email address and clicking the "Subscribe" button.</p>
                    <p>Considering Alex's vision impairment, it is crucial that assistive technology can read the content. 
                        Additionally, we have kept in mind bold and contrasting colors and designs for the new homepage.</p>
